# Cocoa-Flower-and-Fruit-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
his repository presents a deep learning based object detection pipeline for identifying cocoa flowers and cocoa pods in natural field images. The primary objective of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of applying modern object detection techniques to agricultural monitoring tasks under limited data conditions.
