# Cocoa Flower and Fruit Detection Using Deep Learning
This repository presents a deep learning based object detection pipeline for identifying cocoa flowers and cocoa pods in natural field images. The primary objective of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of applying modern object detection techniques to agricultural monitoring tasks under limited data conditions.

The project focuses on two key aspects. First, a label consistent data augmentation strategy is used to address the challenge of small annotated datasets. Second, a two stage deep learning detector is trained and evaluated to localize cocoa flowers and pods using bounding boxes.
